# 🏌️ SwingVista Golf Swing Grading System

## Overview

SwingVista uses advanced computer vision and AI to analyze golf swings with scientific precision. Our system evaluates 5 core metrics and provides detailed feedback based on PGA Tour standards and amateur benchmarks.

## 📊 Core Metrics Explained

### 1. ⏱️ Tempo & Timing

**What it measures:**
- Backswing duration (time from start to top of swing)
- Downswing duration (time from top to impact)
- Tempo ratio (backswing:downswing ratio)

**Professional Standards:**
- Backswing Time: 0.7-0.9 seconds (ideal: 0.8s)
- Downswing Time: 0.23-0.27 seconds (ideal: 0.25s)
- Tempo Ratio: 2.8-3.2 (ideal: 3.0)

**Amateur Standards:**
- Backswing Time: 0.6-1.0 seconds (ideal: 0.8s)
- Downswing Time: 0.2-0.3 seconds (ideal: 0.25s)
- Tempo Ratio: 2.5-3.5 (ideal: 3.0)

**Why it matters:**
- Proper tempo creates power and consistency
- Too fast = loss of control
- Too slow = loss of power
- The 3:1 ratio is the "golden tempo" used by most tour professionals

**How to improve:**
- Practice with a metronome
- Count "one-two-three" for backswing, "one" for downswing
- Focus on smooth acceleration, not speed

### 2. 🔄 Rotation

**What it measures:**
- Shoulder turn (degrees of rotation at top of backswing)
- Hip turn (degrees of hip rotation at top of backswing)
- X-Factor (difference between shoulder and hip turn)

**Professional Standards:**
- Shoulder Turn: 85-95° (ideal: 90°)
- Hip Turn: 45-55° (ideal: 50°)
- X-Factor: 35-45° (ideal: 40°)

**Amateur Standards:**
- Shoulder Turn: 75-95° (ideal: 85°)
- Hip Turn: 35-55° (ideal: 45°)
- X-Factor: 30-45° (ideal: 35°)

**Why it matters:**
- Creates coil and power transfer
- X-Factor stores energy for the downswing
- Proper rotation prevents over-swinging

**How to improve:**
- Practice shoulder turn with a mirror
- Keep lead arm straight during backswing
- Feel the stretch in your back muscles
- Don't let hips turn too much

### 3. ⚖️ Weight Transfer

**What it measures:**
- Weight distribution at backswing (trail foot percentage)
- Weight distribution at impact (lead foot percentage)
- Weight distribution at finish (lead foot percentage)

**Professional Standards:**
- Backswing: 80-90% on trail foot (ideal: 85%)
- Impact: 80-90% on lead foot (ideal: 85%)
- Finish: 90-100% on lead foot (ideal: 95%)

**Amateur Standards:**
- Backswing: 70-90% on trail foot (ideal: 80%)
- Impact: 70-90% on lead foot (ideal: 80%)
- Finish: 80-100% on lead foot (ideal: 90%)

**Why it matters:**
- Proper weight shift generates power
- Prevents reverse pivot
- Creates proper impact position

**How to improve:**
- Practice weight shift drills
- Feel pressure in trail foot at top
- Shift to lead foot during downswing
- Finish with weight on lead foot

### 4. 🎯 Swing Plane

**What it measures:**
- Shaft angle relative to ground at impact
- Deviation from ideal swing plane throughout swing
- Consistency of plane angle

**Professional Standards:**
- Shaft Angle: 55-65° from ground (ideal: 60°)
- Plane Deviation: 0-4° from ideal (ideal: 2°)

**Amateur Standards:**
- Shaft Angle: 50-70° from ground (ideal: 60°)
- Plane Deviation: 0-8° from ideal (ideal: 4°)

**Why it matters:**
- Consistent plane = consistent ball striking
- Prevents slices and hooks
- Creates proper club path

**How to improve:**
- Use alignment sticks for plane training
- Practice with a mirror
- Focus on one-piece takeaway
- Keep club on plane during backswing

### 5. 🎯 Body Alignment

**What it measures:**
- Spine angle (forward lean from vertical)
- Head movement (lateral movement in inches)
- Knee flex (bend in knees)

**Professional Standards:**
- Spine Angle: 35-45° from vertical (ideal: 40°)
- Head Movement: 0-4 inches (ideal: 2")
- Knee Flex: 20-30° (ideal: 25°)

**Amateur Standards:**
- Spine Angle: 30-50° from vertical (ideal: 40°)
- Head Movement: 0-6 inches (ideal: 3")
- Knee Flex: 15-35° (ideal: 25°)

**Why it matters:**
- Maintains balance and consistency
- Prevents swaying
- Creates proper posture

**How to improve:**
- Practice posture drills
- Keep head still during swing
- Maintain knee flex throughout
- Focus on spine angle at address
