| **⏱️ Tempo** | Backswing/Downswing timing | 0.8s/0.25s (3:1 ratio) | 0.8s/0.25s (3:1 ratio) | Smooth rhythm |
| **🔄 Rotation** | Shoulder/Hip turn & X-Factor | 90°/50°/40° | 85°/45°/35° | Coil & power |
| **⚖️ Weight Transfer** | Foot pressure distribution | 85% trail → 85% lead | 80% trail → 80% lead | Power generation |
| **🎯 Swing Plane** | Club path consistency | 60° angle, 2° deviation | 60° angle, 4° deviation | Ball striking |
| **🎯 Body Alignment** | Posture & stability | 40° spine, 2" head move | 40° spine, 3" head move | Balance |

## 🏆 Grading Scale

| Grade | Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **A** | 90-100 | Tour | Excellent technique |
| **B** | 80-89 | Advanced | Very good, minor issues |
| **C** | 70-79 | Intermediate | Good fundamentals |

## 📱 Recording Tips

- **Camera**: Hip height, 6-8 feet away, side view
- **Lighting**: Good lighting on body, avoid backlighting
- **Frame**: Full body from head to feet
- **Duration**: 5-20 seconds
- **File Size**: Under 50MB

## 🎯 Quick Improvements

### Tempo Issues
- Practice with metronome
- Count "one-two-three" backswing, "one" downswing

### Rotation Problems
- Mirror work for shoulder turn
- Keep lead arm straight
- Feel stretch in back muscles

### Weight Transfer
- Pressure in trail foot at top
- Shift to lead foot during downswing
- Finish with weight on lead foot

### Plane Problems
- Use alignment sticks
- One-piece takeaway
- Keep club on plane

### Alignment Issues
- Maintain spine angle
- Keep head still
- Stable knee flex

## 🔬 How It Works

1. **MediaPipe** detects 33 body landmarks
2. **Swing phases** identified (address, backswing, downswing, follow-through)
3. **Mathematical calculations** measure angles, timing, and movement
4. **AI analysis** provides feedback and tips
5. **Grading system** compares against pro/amateur standards
